# Change Log

## [1.0.0] - 2019-08-21
- [Changed] Major refactor of Android Service architecture.  The SDK no longer requires a foreground-service active at all times.  The foreground-service (and cooresponding persistent notification) will only be active while the SDK is in the *moving* state.  No breaking dart api changes.
- [Changed] Improved Android debug notifications.

- [Added] Added new Config options `persistMode` for specifying exactly which events get persisted: location | geofence | all | none.
- [Added] Experimental Android-only Config option `speedJumpFilter (default 300 meters/second)` for detecting location anomalies.  The plugin will measure the distance and apparent speed of the current location relative to last location.  If the apparent speed is > `speedJumpFilter`, the location will be ignored.  Some users, particularly in Australia, curiously, have had locations suddenly jump hundreds of kilometers away, into the ocean.
- [Changed] iOS and Android will not perform odometer updates when the calculated distance is less than the average accuracy of the current and previous location.  This is to prevent small odometer changes when the device is lingering around the same position.

- [Added] New `DeviceSettings` API for redirecting user to Android Settings screens, including vendor-specific screens (eg: Huawei, OnePlus, Xiaomi, etc).  This is an attempt to help direct the user to appropriate device-settings screens for poor Android vendors as detailed in the site [Don't kill my app](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).
- [Added] `schedule` can now be configured to optionally execute geofences-only mode (ie: `#startGeofences`) per schedule entry.  See `schedule` docs.
- [Changed] Update Gradle config to use `implementation` instead of deprecated `compile`
- **[BREAKING]** Change Gradle `ext` configuration property `googlePlayServicesVersion` -> `googlePlayServicesLocationVersion`.  Now that Google has decoupled all their libraries, `play-services:location` now has its own version, independant of all other libs.

`android/build.gradle`:
```diff
buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "28.0.3"
        minSdkVersion = 16
        compileSdkVersion = 28
        targetSdkVersion = 27
        supportLibVersion = "28.0.0"
-       googlePlayServicesVersion = "16.0.0"
+       googlePlayServicesLocationVersion = "16.0.0"
    }
}
```

### New Features

- [Added] Android implementation for `useSignificantChangesOnly` Config option.  Will request Android locations **without the persistent foreground service**.  You will receive location updates only a few times per hour:

#### `useSignificantChangesOnly: true`:

#### `useSignificantChangesOnly: false`:

- [Added] Android now implements a "stationary geofence", just like iOS.  It currently acts as a secondary triggering mechanism along with the current motion-activity API.  You will hear the "zap" sound effect when it triggers.  This also has the fortunate consequence of allowing mock-location apps (eg: Lockito) of being able to trigger tracking automatically.

- [Added] The SDK detects mock locations and skips trigging the `stopTimeout` system, improving location simulation workflow.
- [Added] Android-only Config option `geofenceModeHighAccuracy` for more control over geofence triggering responsiveness.  Runs a foreground-service during geofences-only mode (`#startGeofences`).  This will, of course, consume more power.

#### `geofenceModeHighAccuracy: false` (Default)

- Transition events are delayed in favour of lower power consumption.

#### `geofenceModeHighAccuracy: true`

- Transition events are nearly instantaneous at the cost of higher power consumption.

- [Added] Android implementation of `startBackgroundTask` / `stopBackgroundTask`.

Logging for Android background-tasks looks like this (when you see an hourglass, a foreground-service is active)
```
 [BackgroundTaskManager onStartJob] ⏳ startBackgroundTask: 6
 .
 .
 .
 [BackgroundTaskManager$Task stop] ⏳ stopBackgroundTask: 6
```
- [Added] New custom Android debug sound FX.  See the [Config.debug](https://transistorsoft.github.io/cordova-background-geolocation/interfaces/_cordova_background_geolocation_.config.html#debug) for a new decription of iOS / Android sound FX **including a media player to play each.**

### Removed
- [Changed] Removed Android config option **`activityRecognitionInterval`** and **`minimumActivityRecognitionConfidence`**.  The addition of the new "stationary geofence" for Android should alleviate issues with poor devices failing to initiate tracking.  The Android SDK now uses the more modern [ActivityTransistionClient](https://medium.com/life360-engineering/beta-testing-googles-new-activity-transition-api-c9c418d4b553) API which is a higher level wrapper for the traditional [ActivityReconitionClient](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/ActivityRecognitionClient).  `AcitvityTransitionClient` does not accept a polling `interval`, thus `actiivtyRecognitionInterval` is now unused.  Also, `ActivityTransitionClient` emits similar `on_foot`, `in_vehicle` events but no longer provides a `confidence`, thus `confidence` is now reported always as `100`.  If you've been implementing your own custom triggering logic based upon `confidence`, it's now pointless.  The `ActivityTransitionClient` will open doors for new features based upon transitions between activity states.

- [Changed] Android: `setShowBadge(false)` on Android `NotificationChannel`.  Some users reporting that Android shows a badge-count on app icon when service is started / stopped.
- [Added] Added method `getProviderState` for querying current state of location-services.
- [Added] Added method `requestPermission` for manually requesting location-permission (`#start`, `#getCurrentPosition`, `#watchPosition` etc, will already automatically request permission.
- [Changed] Upgrade Android logger dependency to latest version (`logback`).
- [Fixed] Prevent Android foreground-service from auto-starting when location permission is revoked via Settings screen.
- [Fixed] NPE in Android HTTP Service when manual sync is called.  Probably a threading issue with multiple sync operations executed simultaneously.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-10-30
- [Added] Android SDK 28 requires new permission to use foreground-service.
- [Fixed] Android `NullPointerException` on `WatchPositionCallback` with `watchPosition`.
- [Fixed] iOS Catch `NSInvalidArgumentException` when decoding `TSConfig`.
- [Fixed] iOS scheduler not being initialized in `#ready` after reboot.
- [Changed] Android headless events are now posted with using `EventBus` instead of `JobScheduler`.  Events posted via Android `JobScheduler` are subject to time-slicing by the OS so events could arrive late.

## [0.1.1] - 2018-06-26

- [Added] iOS support for HTTP method `PATCH` (Android already supports it).
- [Fixed] Android was not using `httpTimeout` with latest `okhttp3`.
- [Fixed] Android issue not firing `providerchange` on boot when configured with `stopOnTerminate: true`
- [Fixed] Android `httpTimeout` was not being applied to new `okhttp3.Client#connectionTimeout`
- [Fixed] Apply recommended XCode build settings.
- [Fixed] XCode warnings 'implicity retain self in block'
- [Changed] Android Removed unnecessary attribute `android:supportsRtl="true"` from `AndroidManifest`
- [Fixed] iOS `preventSuspend` was not working with `useSignificantChangesOnly`
- [Changed] iOS disable encryption on SQLite database file when "Data Protection" capability is enabled with `NSFileProtectionNone` so that plugin can continue to insert records while device is locked.
- [Fixed] iOS issue when plugin is booted in background in geofences-only mode, could engage location-tracking mode.
- [Fixed] Android `getCurrentPosition` was not respecting `persist: true` when executed in geofences-only mode.
- [Fixed] iOS geofence exit was being ignored in a specific case where (1) geofence was configured with `notifyOnDwell: true` AND (2) the app was booted in the background *due to* a geofence exit event.
